# Weekly Work

In my own time, I am choosing to work through different exercises of my own creation to continue to work with Data as I look for a 
position in the field. These exercises will primarily use python in Jupyter and vary between cleaning, modeling, 
creating/manipulating raw data, web scraping, etc. but occasionally will use MySQL, Excel VBA, and Tableau as well.
Note: this project originally ran on a 'project per week' schedule hence the initial names of weeks 1-5 but were amended to 'projects'.

(Week 1): Kaggle Dataset
(Week 2/3): Personal Dataset + Dashboard
(Week 4): basic SQL practice
(Week 5): MB_House_Pricing_Regression expanded (current)
Project 6: Scraping
Future: more SQL, scraping, tableau, excel VBA, regex
