# Weekly Work

In my own time, I am choosing to work through different exercises of my own creation to continue to work with Data as I look for a 
position in the field. These exercises will primarily use python in Jupyter and vary between cleaning, modeling, 
creating/manipulating raw data, web scraping, etc. but occasionally will use MySQL and Tableau as well.

Week 1: Kaggle Dataset
Week 2/3: Personal Dataset + Dashboard

Next:
Week 4: Web Scraping
Week 5: Housing Project continued
